## 🎬 YouTube Frontend – Real-World Video Streaming App (React + Vite)
 This project is a production-oriented YouTube-like frontend application built with React, Vite, Redux
 Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. It focuses on real-world video streaming behavior, performance
 optimization, and scalable frontend architecture.
 
 ## Key Highlights
 • Real-world HLS streaming concept (chunk-based loading)
 • Smooth video playback without full file download
 • Redux-based global state management
 • Clean and scalable project structure
 • Service-layer API architecture
 
 ## 🎥 Video Streaming Explanation
 Videos do not load completely at once. Instead, the application uses HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
 concepts where video data is delivered in small chunks. Only the required segments are fetched
 based on playback position. This improves startup time, reduces bandwidth usage, and ensures
 smooth playback even on slow networks. This approach reflects how platforms like YouTube and
 Netflix handle video streaming in real-world production systems.

 ## ⚡ Performance & User Experience
